You {\it must} label all axes of all plots, including giving the {\it
  units}!!

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Exercise 4.3 of Newman.

  \item Read Example 4.3 in Newman. Using successively larger matrices
    (10$\times$10, 30$\times$30, etc.) find empirically and plot how
    the matrix multiplication computation rises with matrix size. Does
    it rise as $N^3$ as predicted? Use both an explicit function
    (i.e. the one in the example) and use the {\tt dot()} method. How
    do they differ?

  \item Exercise 10.2 in Newman.
  \item Exercise 10.4 in Newman.

\end{enumerate}
